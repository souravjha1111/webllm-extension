- **Node.js & npm**: This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) to be installed on your system.
  - Download and install from: https://nodejs.org/
  - After installation, verify by running:
    ```

## 1. Installation

   - Extract the `adblock-extension.zip` file to a folder on your computer.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Open a terminal/command prompt in the extracted folder.
   - Run:

     ```
   - This will install all required libraries, including:

     - `progressbar.js`
     - (and development tools like `parcel`)

## 2. Load the Extension in Chrome

## 3. Usage

- Navigate to your LinkedIn feed.
- The extension will automatically scan posts and inject a summary box to the right of each post.
- The summary will update after a few seconds ("Summarizing..." will be replaced by the actual summary).

## 4. What to Expect

- **Summary Box**: For each LinkedIn post, a summary box will appear on the right side of the post.
- **Automatic Updates**: As you scroll and new posts load, summaries will be generated automatically.
- **No Manual Action Needed**: The extension works in the background; you do not need to click anything.

## 5. Troubleshooting

- If you do not see summaries, try refreshing the LinkedIn feed page.
- Make sure you have allowed the extension to run on linkedin.com.
- Check the browser console for errors if something is not working.
